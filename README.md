# Work-day-scheduler

## Overview 
In this module I practiced dayjs and local storage. With localstorage, the event entered into the timeblock will remain on display and stored in local storage wjen the webpage is refreshed. 
Dayjs allowed me to input the current date, day and time while keeping it current. The timeblocks are color coded depending if it is a past, present or current event.
